Writing crazy stories isnâ€™t enough for you?  Every sentence you write will compete to be the best, and for winning the title of Top Writer!

Future goals
- After playtesting our game, we realize our game has great potential in developing into an Language education game instead of a party game. For example, we want to target 2nd grade elementry students with topics like write about an elephant that poops to make writing in class more interesting.
